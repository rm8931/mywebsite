<p>Swimming is a part of me because i can make new friends, and i really just swimming because it<em>
  helps <em/> create new relashonships,strengthens our personal character<em>, 
   and <em/> creats new oppurtunits for me. That is not really WHY I swim. I just LOVE swimming and<em> 
  I<em/> feel happy and relaxed when i swim. I started swimming when I was born.Yes really!<em>
  My <em/>dad took me into the ocean for a splash with him and <strong>instantly</strong> I fell in love.<p>
